# Welcome to my Project 6 page.

## Project 6 consisted of:
- Creating three classes. The first class is the Shape class that will serve as a base class for the other two classes. The second class is the Rectangle class that will inherit from Shape class. A class that inherits from another class can be called the child class of the base, or parent, class. The third class is the Triangle class that also will inherit from the Shape class.The base Shape class will provide the common functionality of a method that returns the perimeter value. Each of the other two classes will provide their own versions of a method that returns the area value. 

## What I learned:
- Gained experience creating and working classes with inheritance
- Gained more experience creating and working with classes
- Gained more experience debugging code
- Gained more experience using a generic block of code to process data
- Gained more experience interpreting functional descriptions and specifications to complete an assignment
- Gained more experience writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code using VSCode
- Practiced using modern JavaScript syntax
- Gained more experience working with static data
